# Personal-Chat-bot
This project is a beginner-friendly Python chatbot designed to respond to basic user queries through predefined keywords. It interacts with users via terminal input and provides responses based on matched phrases. The chatbot also includes a time-based greeting system that adjusts the welcome message according to the current hour.

# Features

* Greets users based on morning, afternoon, evening, or night.
* Accepts user input and responds with predefined answers.
* Contains a basic dictionary mapping keywords to responses.
* Detects when the user wants to exit and ends the program safely.
* Demonstrates a simple example of flow and logic in Python.

## How It Works

* The chatbot checks system time and greets the user accordingly.
* A dictionary is used to store keywords and responses.
* The program listens continuously until the user types "bye".
* If no keyword is matched, a default learning-mode response is shown.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Standard libraries: datetime, time

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script in a Python file.
3. Open your terminal.
4. Run:

```
python filename.py
```

5. Interact by typing questions directly into the terminal.

## Possible Enhancements

* Integrate machine learning for dynamic responses.
* Add GUI using Tkinter or web framework.
* Expand the response dictionary.
* Connect to APIs for real-time information.

## Purpose of the Project

This project is suitable for beginners learning Python, understanding input handling, working with dictionaries, and creating simple logic-based applications.
